![Woo-wee, Wednesday's got somethin' special! We're havin' a *Walkin' Taco with Rice*! No hot alternate today, but don't you worry your little heads, 'cause there's a *Ham & Swiss on a Pretzel Roll* waitin' for ya! And we got that *Crispy Chicken Salad* that's always a crowd-pleaser. Now, don't forget your veggies! Get a scoop of those *Texas Ranchero Beans* and finish it off with a sweet *Strawberry Cup* and your *Choice of Fruit & Milk*! It's gonna be a scorcher!](image.png)
